## Models

We have prepared the top neural GEC system described in the paper that is an
ensemble of four transformer models and a neural language model. Each
translation model is pretrained with a language model and trained using
edit-weighted MLE objective on NUCLE and Lang-8 data.

The systems are created using training settings that are very similar to those
described in the paper.  Small performance differences occur mainly due to the
use of a more recent version of the Marian toolkit that comes with new
features.  The most noticable change is replacing averaged model checkpoints by
exponential smoothing.  Differences in less significant training
hyperparameters might also exist.  Other settings, including data and data
preprocessing, remain exactly the same as in the original paper.

## Content

- `models` - pretrained neural models, instructions on how to use them, and
  scripts to evaluate the system on the CoNLL and JFLEG data sets
- `outputs` - corrected outputs and evaluation scores for the CoNLL and JFLEG
  data sets generated by the prepared GEC system
- `training` - complete training pipeline reproducing the prepared neural
  models

In case of any questions, please open an issue or send me (Roman) an email.
